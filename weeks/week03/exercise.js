/**
 * Week 3 - A Larger Example (String, Array, RegExp):
 * 
 * Write a series of functions to accomplish the following, building a larger program as you go:
 * 
 * 1. Split the string into an `Array` of separate rows (i.e., an `Array` with rows separated by `\n`).
 *    Bonus: how could we deal with data that includes both Unix (`\n`) and Windows (`\r\n`) line endings?
 * 
 * 2. Each row contains information user info: `ID`, `Name`, `Phone Number`, and `Height` info all separated by commas.
 *    Split each row into an `Array` with all of its different fields.  You need to deal with extra and/or no
 *    whitespace between the commas.
 * 
 * 3. Get rid of any extra spaces around the `Name` field
 * 
 * 4. Using a `RegExp`, extract the Area Code from the `Phone Number` field.  All `Phone Number`s are in one of two
 *    formats: `"555-555-5555"` or `"5555555555"`.
 * 
 * 5. Check if the `Height` field has `"cm"` at the end.  If it does, strip that out, convert the number to inches,
 *    and turn it into a `String` in the form `"xx inches"`.  For example: `"152 cm"` should become `"59 inches"`.  
 * 
 * 6. After doing all of the above steps, create a new record with `ID`, `Name`, `Area Code`, `Height In Inches`
 *    and separate them with commas.
 * 
 * 7. Combine all these processed records into a new CSV formatted string, with rows separated by `\n`.
 * 
 * Sample Data:
 * 
 * ```
 * 0134134,John Smith,555-567-2341,62 inches\n
 * 0134135   ,    June    Lee    ,  5554126347 ,        149 cm\n
 * 0134136,       Kim Thomas       , 5324126347, 138cm\n
 * ```
